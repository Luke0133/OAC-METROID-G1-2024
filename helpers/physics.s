# Uppon calling PHYSICS, it is assumed that the address of the  #
# current map is already stored on CURRENT_MAP. This label will	#
#    store the current map's address, so it is a "pointer" to   #
#    another "pointer". Remember that when loading the map's	#
#   address (load address of CURRENT_MAP, then load word from	# 
#      CURRENT_MAP: this will be the current map's address)	    #
